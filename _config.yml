          This interdisciplinary project aimed to enhance pain assessment in 
          clinical settings by seamlessly integrating advanced computational 
          techniques and in-depth medical imaging analysis.
          
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          As a component of my Ph.D. thesis, this project focused on constructing 
          a machine learning pipeline for pain detection, 
          utilizing radiographic images of patients with bone metastasis. 
          Our pipeline integrates pain scores extracted from clinical notes 
          using Natural Language Processing (NLP) with radiomic-based imaging 
          features derived from CT scans of patients with bone metastases. 
          Using Python, I developed a neural network model to understand the 
          relationship between perceived pain and the distinct characteristics of 
          bone metastatic lesions, allowing for the prediction of pain in future patients.

            As a Teaching Assistant at the McGill Medical Physics Unit, 
            I crafted and delivered the "Python for Medical Physicists" 
            courseâ€”an immersive educational experience designed to instill 
            Python programming skills tailored for medical physicists. 
            Aligned with the unit's mission, my objective was to equip 
            students with essential coding proficiency, covering the spectrum 
            from the fundamentals of Python syntax to advanced concepts. 
            I expanded the curriculum to encompass web application design, 
            database interaction, and the intricate handling of DICOM images, 
            ensuring students could seamlessly integrate Python into their 
            medical physics endeavors.

            As a data scientist at Farmers Edge, I leveraged innovation 
            and data-driven solutions in precision agriculture. 
            Aligned with the company's mission, my goal was to enable end-to-end 
            farm management and promote sustainable practices within the agriculture 
            industry to maximize returns.

            My involvement spanned various projects, 
            including virtual soil testing, satellite-based crop classification, 
            automated cloud detection, and yield/harvest time prediction. Additionally, 
            I played a major role in optimizing data pipelines, contributing 
            to the seamless integration and analysis of agricultural data.

            As an Embedded Software Engineer, 
            I oversaw data flow and conversion for over 250 models of various farming 
            equipment, including harvesters, planters, and sprayers from manufacturers 
            like Claas, John Deere, and New Holland.

            My responsibilities included collecting binary data from the machine's 
            CAN bus terminal, transmitting it to a cloud database via cellular network, 
            and performing reverse engineering for decoding precision 
            agriculture attributes such as grain flow, yield, or fertilizer 
            application rate. Throughout this role, 
            I gained hands-on experience in vehicle network engineering, 
            constructing data pipelines, 
            ensuring data quality, and maintaining databases.

          Beyond physics and data science, 
          I enjoy crafting tools with 3D printing and microcontrollers. 
          
          My other interests include hiking, camping, cooking 
          and spending quality time with family.
